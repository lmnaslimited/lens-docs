   - **Type**: Link  
   - **Fieldname**: `reference_doctype`  
   - **Options**: DocType
3. Add the second field:
   - **Label**: Reference Name  
   - **Type**: Dynamic Link  
   - **Fieldname**: `reference_name`  
   - **Options**: `reference_doctype` (this should match the fieldname of the Link field above)

This setup allows users to first select a Doctype and then pick a specific document from that Doctype.

2. Add a new field with the following configuration:
   - **Label**: Test Scripts  
   - **Type**: Table MultiSelect  
   - **Options**: Test Plan Script (Name of the child table)
