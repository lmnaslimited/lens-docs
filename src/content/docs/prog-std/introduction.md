## Why Have Programming Standards?

Programming standards are essential for ensuring that code remains consistent, maintainable, and scalable over time. Without clear coding guidelines, a project can quickly become chaotic, leading to inconsistent practices, increased complexity, and difficulty in debugging and extending the codebase. Programming standards serve as a blueprint to avoid these issues, enabling a smoother development process and better collaboration across teams.

## Objectives of This Guide

This documentation aims to establish clear and actionable guidelines to:

- Ensure consistency across all projects and development teams.
- Improve the readability and maintainability of code, making it easier to understand and modify.
- Optimize performance by incorporating best practices for writing efficient and scalable code.
- Minimize bugs and technical debt through the use of structured programming principles.
- Promote collaboration by adhering to a common standard that everyone can follow.

## Who Should Follow These Standards?

This guide is intended for:

- **Developers** writing code for applications, custom scripts, or system extensions.

- **Testers** responsible for validating functionality and ensuring bug-free code.

## Scope of This Documentation

This guide will cover best practices across several critical areas:

- **Naming Conventions** – Establish predictable and standardized naming patterns for variables, functions, classes, and files to ensure consistency and avoid ambiguity.

- **JavaScript & Python Best Practices** – Recommendations for writing clean, efficient, and readable code in both JavaScript and Python.

- **SQL Query Guidelines** – Tips for writing secure, optimized, and efficient database queries to avoid common pitfalls such as SQL injection or performance bottlenecks.

- **Looping & Performance** – Guidelines on optimizing loops and iteration methods to enhance performance, particularly in large-scale data operations.

- **Issue Tracking & Code Comments** – Strategies for documenting code with appropriate comments and utilizing issue tracking to improve debugging and maintain project clarity.
