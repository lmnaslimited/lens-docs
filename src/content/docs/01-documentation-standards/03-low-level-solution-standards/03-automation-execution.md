title: Low-Level Solution (LLS) - Automation Story
---

 
This **LLS for Automation** provides detailed technical insights into the automation implementation, including code references, algorithms, and execution details. 

A Low-Level Solution (LLS) for Automation should include:  
- **Full Implementation Details:** The exact components, modules, or services automated.  
- **Git References & Function Paths:** Where the automation script is implemented within the repository.  
- **Step-by-Step Algorithm:** The logical approach used to automate the process.  
- **Code Snippets:** Examples showcasing automation logic and execution.  
- **Execution & Validation:** How to test and validate automation success.  


## 1. Full Implementation Details  
The automation implementation includes:  
- **Automation Type:** (Script-based, Event-driven, CI/CD integrated, etc.)  
- **Technology Stack:** (Selenium with Python, Cypress with JavaScript, etc.)  
- **Execution Method:** (Triggered by user action, scheduled jobs, API requests, etc.)  
- **Integration Points:** (Databases, APIs, external services)  

## 2. Git Reference & Function Path  
Mention the specific **files, functions, and repositories** where the automation script is located.  

- **Repository Name:** `<Repo_Name>`  
- **File Path:** `<Path/to/AutomationScript>`  
- **Function Name:** `<Automated_Function>`  
- **Branch/Commit Reference:** `<Commit_Hash>`  

## 3. Step-by-Step Algorithm  
Below is a structured algorithm to define the automation process:

```pseudo
Algorithm ExecuteAutomation()
BEGIN
    1. Initialize required configurations and environment variables.
    2. Validate system prerequisites (e.g., API availability, credentials).
    3. Trigger the automation process:
        a. If event-based, listen for the trigger.
        b. If script-based, execute predefined test scenarios.
    4. Perform the automated workflow:
        a. Fetch required data (API/database calls).
        b. Execute automated actions (e.g., UI navigation, form submission).
        c. Capture and log results.
    5. Validate execution results:
        a. Compare actual results with expected outcomes.
        b. Handle errors or unexpected responses.
    6. Generate test reports/logs for debugging.
    7. Notify relevant teams if required (e.g., Slack alerts, email notifications).
    8. Exit process.
