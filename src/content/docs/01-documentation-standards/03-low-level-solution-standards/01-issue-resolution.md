title: Low-Level Solution (LLS) - Issue Story 
---

This **Low-Level Solution (LLS) template** provides a **detailed technical breakdown** of the implementation required to fix an issue.  

 **Low-Level Solution (LLS)** should include:  
- **Full Implementation Details:** Outline the exact code changes, modifications, and impact.  
- **Code References & Paths:** Specify the exact files, functions, and repository details.  
- **Algorithm / Solution Approach:** Describe the step-by-step logic applied to resolve the issue.  
- **Code Snippets (if applicable):** Provide example code to illustrate the fix.  
- **Validation & Testing:** Ensure the applied fix works as expected through unit and regression testing.  

This document ensures clarity and traceability for developers implementing the fix.

## 1. **Full Implementation Details**  
Provide the complete implementation of the fix, including:  
- The exact **functions, modules, or components** modified.  
- The **logic changes** made and their impact.  
- Any **new files, methods, or classes** introduced.  

## 2. **Code Reference & Function Path**  
Mention the specific **functions, file paths, or repositories** where the implementation is done.  

- **Repository Name:** `<Repository_Name>`  
- **File Path:** `<Path/to/Modified/File>`  
- **Function Name:** `<Modified_Function_Name>`  
- **Branch/Commit Reference:** `<Commit_Hash>`

## 3. **Step-by-Step Algorithm / Solution Approach**  
Describe the approach using a structured algorithm format:  

```pseudo
Algorithm FixIssue()
BEGIN
    1. Identify the issue and analyze the root cause.
    2. Locate the affected function in the codebase.
    3. Modify the logic by applying the required changes.
    4. Ensure compatibility with existing functionality.
    5. Write unit tests to validate the fix.
    6. Run regression tests to verify overall impact.
    7. Commit and push changes to the relevant branch.
    8. If necessary, document the fix and notify relevant teams.
