title: Low-Level Solution (LLS) - Proof of Concept (POC) Story  
---

This **LLS for POC** provides a detailed, workable definition of the chosen approach, including implementation details, execution steps, and validation. It ensures that the concept is fully explored and technically feasible for scaling.

A Low-Level Solution (LLS) for a POC should include:  
- **Full Implementation Details:** The exact approach, logic, and modules used.  
- **Workable Definition of Approach:** A technical breakdown of how the concept is implemented.  
- **Git References & Function Paths:** Repository details, file locations, and commit history.  
- **Code Snippets & Screenshots:** Example code implementations and UI/CLI execution results.  
- **Execution & Validation:** Steps to test and validate the proof of concept.  

---

## 1. Workable Definition of the Selected Approach  
The selected approach `<Approach Name>` is implemented using:  
- **Technology Stack:** `<e.g., Python, Node.js, Kubernetes>`  
- **Architecture:** `<e.g., Microservices, Monolithic>`  
- **Integration Points:** `<APIs, Databases, Message Queues>`  
- **Execution Flow:** `<How the process is triggered and completed>`  

### **Step-by-Step Execution Flow**  
1. **Initialize Environment:** Set up dependencies and configure the system.  
2. **Implement Core Functionality:** Write scripts, API calls, or database interactions.  
3. **Test Edge Cases:** Validate handling of different input scenarios.  
4. **Analyze Results:** Compare expected vs. actual output.  
5. **Assess Performance:** Check execution time, memory usage, and scalability.  
6. **Document Findings:** Capture logs, screenshots, and final observations.

## 2. Git Reference & Function Path  
Provide exact references to the implementation in the codebase:  

- **Repository Name:** `<GitHub/Bitbucket Repository Name>`  
- **Branch Name:** `<Feature_POC_Branch>`  
- **Commit ID:** `<Commit_Hash>`  
- **File Path:** `<src/modules/POC_Implementation.py>`  
- **Function Name:** `<execute_poc()>`

## 3. Code Implementation  
Hereâ€™s an example of the implemented solution in Python:  

```python
import requests

# Function to fetch data from an external API
def fetch_data_from_api():
    url = "https://api.example.com/data"
    headers = {"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}
    
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Failed to fetch data"}

# Execute the proof of concept function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = fetch_data_from_api()
    print("Fetched Data:", data)
