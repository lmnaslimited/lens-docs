title: High-Level Solution (HLS) - Automation Story
---

This **HLS template for an Automation Story** provides a structured framework for designing, implementing, and executing automation processes. It ensures clarity in automation objectives, methodologies, and system interactions.  

A High-Level Solution (HLS) for Automation should include:  
- **Purpose & Expected Outcome:** Define why the automation is needed and what results it aims to achieve.  
- **Prerequisites:** List the required tools, frameworks, programming languages, and system configurations.  
- **Approach:** Outline the methodology, including script-based automation, event-driven execution, and CI/CD integration.  
- **Sequence/Architecture Diagram:** Illustrate the execution flow and interaction between components.  

## 1. Prerequisites  
List the required **tools, platforms, and configurations** needed for the automation, including:  
- **Automation framework** (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Robot Framework).  
- **Programming language** used.  
- **Third-party dependencies or integrations** required.  
- **Access or credentials** needed for execution.  

## 2. Approach  
Explain the **methodology** used for implementing automation, such as:  
- **Script-based automation** or **no-code automation**.  
- **Event-driven automation** (trigger-based execution).  
- **Batch execution or real-time processing**.  
- **Integration with CI/CD pipelines**.  

## 3. Sequence Diagram / Architecture Diagram  
Include a **sequence diagram** or **architecture diagram** that illustrates:  
- The interaction between different **components and systems**.  
- The flow of execution from **trigger to result**.  
- The role of **external services, APIs, and databases**.

    User->>AutomationScript: Initiates Automation
    AutomationScript->>BackendService: Sends Request
    BackendService->>Database: Fetch/Update Data
    Database-->>BackendService: Response
    BackendService-->>AutomationScript: Processed Data
    AutomationScript-->>User: Final Output
