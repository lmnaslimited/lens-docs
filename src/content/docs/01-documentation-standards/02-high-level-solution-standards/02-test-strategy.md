title: High-Level Solution (HLS) - Testing Story
---
This **HLS template for a Testing Story** ensures a structured approach to validating system functionality, performance, and reliability. It helps teams conduct thorough testing by outlining necessary prerequisites, methodologies, and expected outcomes.  

 A High-Level Solution (HLS) for Testing should include:  
- **Prerequisites:** Define tools, environments, and support requirements.  
- **Testing Approach:** Outline different testing methodologies (manual, E2E, integration, unit, BDD).  
- **Test Scenarios & Cases:** Structure test cases with clear inputs, actions, and expected outcomes.  
- **Purpose & Expected Output:** Define the testing objectives, success criteria, and validation checkpoints.  


## 1. **Prerequisites**  
Before testing, ensure the following prerequisites are met:  
- **Tools & Platforms:** List required tools (e.g., Postman, Selenium, JIRA, TestRail). Ensure all configurations like **generator, configurator, and other required system setups** are in place.  
- **Testing Environment:** Mention if testing will be conducted on Local, Quality, or Production environments.  
- **Support Requirements:** Identify if external team support (e.g., API teams, database teams) or internal support (e.g., DevOps, backend teams) is required.  

## 2. **Testing Approach**  
The testing will follow a combination of the following approaches:  
- **Manual Testing** – Functional validation through UI.  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** – Ensuring complete workflow coverage.  
- **Integration Testing** – Verifying API and system interactions.  
- **Unit Testing** – Testing individual components in isolation.  
- **Behavior-Driven Testing** – Validating expected user behaviors.  

## 3. **Test Scenarios & Test Cases**  
Make these setup in the testing tab before executing test scenarios.  

| **Scenario** | **Given** | **When** | **Then** | **Status** |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **[Scenario Name]**  Provide a detailed explanation of the scenario being tested. | Provide a detailed explanation of the input values or actions taken before execution. | Describe the action performed, such as saving a form or clicking a button. | Explain the expected outcome, such as data being saved, page navigation, or message display. | Pass / Fail |

## 4. **Purpose of Testing & Expected Output**  
- **Purpose:** Clearly state why this testing is being conducted (e.g., feature validation, bug verification, performance testing).  
- **Expected Output:** Define what the expected results should be for a successful test (e.g., correct data saving, successful navigation, correct calculations).  
- **Validation Criteria:** List the key validation points that confirm the system works as intended (e.g., no error messages, correct database updates, API response verification).
