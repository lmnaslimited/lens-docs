# Data Processing Steps - Detailed Explanation

## 1. Filter the Dataset
- Before you start any analysis, narrow down your data to only what’s necessary.  
- Filtering means removing records that aren’t relevant to your current Usecase.  
- For example, if analyzing sales orders for the last year, exclude orders older than that.  
- This makes the dataset smaller, so processing is faster and easier.  
- It also improves accuracy by preventing outdated or irrelevant data from affecting results.  
- Applying filters early saves time and keeps your focus on important data.

## 2. Find the Relationship
- Understand how the two datasets connect, like customers (parent) and their orders (child).  
- Identify a common key field (e.g., Customer ID ) used to link the datasets.  
- This relationship helps you match orders with the correct customers.  
- Check the data to make sure these keys exist in both datasets.  
- If multiple keys are possible, pick the one that is most consistent and reliable.  .

## 3. Check if Relationship Exists
- Test whether the key fields actually match between the two datasets.  
- Perform a sample join or lookup to see how many records from one dataset link to the other.    
- Don’t continue processing until you confirm the datasets can be linked properly.  
- Fix any data quality problems that prevent matching before moving forward.  
- Clear relationships prevent errors and make your analysis reliable.

## 4. Make Data Unique and Easy to Search
- If there is no relationship between the dataset .
- Remove duplicates so that each key (e.g., Customer ID) appears only once in each dataset.  
- Sort the datasets by the key field to organize data for efficient searching.  
- Use binary search or similar fast search methods to quickly find matching records.  
- Unique, sorted data helps prevent mistakes and speeds up data processing.  
- If using a database, create indexes on key columns for faster queries.
