###  Visualization  Standards

| **Category**            | **Standard**                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Basic Functionality** | Basic filters should be available to narrow down data (e.g., by date range, category, status).                                  |
|                         | Common or frequently used filter values should be preloaded or suggested within the filters.                                    |
| **Chart Interactions**  | Charts must display a tooltip with detailed information when the user hovers over data points.                                  |
| **Table/Column Specs**  | The column used on the x-axis must have **unique colors** to avoid ambiguity in visualizations.                                 |
|                         | All columns must have clear, readable labels.                                                                                   |
|                         | Columns should have an option to expand, especially if they contain long text or detailed information.                          |
|                         | A search bar must be available at the **bottom** of each column for quick filtering.                                            |
|                         | Key columns (e.g., primary identifiers) should remain fixed when scrolling horizontally.                                        |
|                         | Each column should include options for sorting (ascending/descending) and the ability to hide/remove it.                        |
|                         | Users should be able to drag and shift columns to customize their view.                                                         |
| **Link Field Behavior** | If a column contains a link field (e.g., to another document or file), clicking it should redirect to the appropriate resource. |
| **Visual Enhancements** | Column headers should be visually distinct (e.g., bold, color, or background) for better readability.                           |
|                         | When hovering over truncated or overflowing content, the full value should be displayed in a tooltip or below the cursor.       |
