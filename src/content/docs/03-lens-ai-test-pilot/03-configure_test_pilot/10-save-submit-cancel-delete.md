## Steps to Configure Save, Submit, Cancel, and Delete Actions

These actions simulate basic user operations on forms in **Lens AI Test Pilot**. They help you test how the form behaves during each critical state change â€” from saving to deleting.

> ðŸ”¹ **Note:**
> - These actions are **standalone**, meaning they donâ€™t require field-level input.
> - Typically placed at **top-level positions** (e.g., `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`), based on when they occur in the test sequence.


### Configuration Guide

| **Field**      | **Description**                                                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Action`       | Use one of: `Save`, `Submit`, `Cancel`, or `Delete`.                   |
| `Pos`          | Order of the action in the test sequence (e.g., `10`, `20`, etc.).     |
| `Field Name`   | Leave blank.                                                           |
| `Value`        | Leave blank.                                                           |
| `Data Type`    | Not applicable.                                                        |
| `Is Child`     | Not applicable.                                                        |
| `Tab`          | Not required.                                                          |
