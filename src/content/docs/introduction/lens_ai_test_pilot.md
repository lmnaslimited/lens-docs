## What is LENS AI Test Pilot?

LENS AI Test Pilot is a tool that automates the testing of web applications using Cypress. Traditionally, testing was done after development, which caused delays and issues. Now, with LENS AI Test Pilot, you can create automated test scripts *before* development even begins. This allows testing and development to happen at the same time, speeding up the process and improving product quality.

It simplifies the testing process by automating repetitive tasks, allowing both developers and testers to focus on building the software, not on repetitive testing.

## Why Use It?

The old way of using Cypress for testing was slow and time-consuming. It required manually selecting paths, writing a separate script for each feature, and managing many test files. This process was prone to errors as the project grew. LENS AI Test Pilot solves this by streamlining the process. It uses TypeScript to store test values, making it easier to configure and manage tests.

With the **Test Case Configurator**, anyone (even non-developers) can create tests just by defining the scenario, without needing to understand the code. This transforms the testing process into an easy, automated experience where the focus is on results, not the code behind them.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Testing and Development**: Create test cases first and begin development immediately after. This saves time and speeds up the overall process.
- **Test Case Configurator**: A simple interface that lets users create test cases without writing any code. The tool will automatically generate test scripts for you.
- **Automated Test Script Generation**: Once you define a test scenario, LENS AI Test Pilot automatically creates the necessary test scripts, saving time and reducing errors.
- **Centralized Test Management**: Store all your test data in one place, making it easy to manage and update tests for your application.
- **Efficient Test Data Handling**: LENS AI Test Pilot uses TypeScript to store and organize test values, making it easier to scale and maintain as your project grows.
