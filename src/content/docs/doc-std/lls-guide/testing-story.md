title: Low-Level Solution (LLS) - Testing Story  
---

This **Low-Level Solution (LLS) - Testing Story** provides a **detailed breakdown** of the testing execution for a given feature, fix, or enhancement.  

A **Testing LLS** should include:  
- **Test Execution Details** – The environment, tools, and setup required for testing.  
- **Test Scenarios & Cases** – A structured format for test cases, covering conditions, actions, and expected results.  
- **Testing Output & Results** – The summary of the test execution, including pass/fail status.  
- **Defects & Issues Identified** – Any issues discovered during testing with defect tracking details.  
- **Retesting & Regression Testing** – Verification of defect fixes and validation of system stability.  
- **Additional Notes** – Configuration changes, API interactions, and suggested improvements.  





## 1. **Test Execution Details**  
Provide details of how the test was executed, including:  
- The **test environment** (e.g., Local, QA, Staging, Production).  
- The **tools and frameworks** used for testing (e.g., Selenium, JUnit, TestNG, Configurator).  
- Any **preconditions or setup** required before running the test.  



## 2. **Test Scenarios & Cases**  
Outline the test scenarios and test cases executed, including:  

| **Scenario** | **Given** | **When** | **Then** | **Status** |
|-------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Detailed scenario explanation** | **Input steps or actions taken** | **Action performed (e.g., click, submit, execute command)** | **Expected system behavior (e.g., page navigates, data updates, validation message appears, etc.)** | ✅ Pass / ❌ Fail |



## 3. **Testing Output & Results**  
- The **final test execution status** (Pass/Fail).  
- If **all test cases passed**, mention the successful validation.  
- If **some test cases failed**, list the failed scenarios with possible reasons.  



## 4. **Defects & Issues Identified**  
If any issues were found during testing:  
 
- **Description:** Explain the issue, how it was found, and its impact.  
- **Steps to Reproduce:**  
  1. Step 1 – Describe what was done.  
  2. Step 2 – Mention the observed failure.  
  3. Step 3 – Expected vs. Actual outcome.  


## 5. **Retesting & Regression**  
- If defects were fixed, mention the **retesting results**.  
- If regression testing was performed, list the **other areas validated** to ensure no new issues were introduced.  



## 6. **Additional Notes**  
- Any **configuration changes** required for testing.  
- If external integrations were tested, mention the **API calls, endpoints, or services validated**.  
- Any **suggestions for improvement** in testing coverage.
