title: Git Tool Integration Overview
description: Connect Nectar with Git to streamline repository creation and project assignment.
---

The **Git Tool Integration** feature links your **Nectar** with Git providers.  
This allows product owners and project managers to create and manage repositories directly from Nectar without needing to leave the platform.

---

### Key Capabilities

- **Repository Creation from Nectar**  
  Product Owners can create new Git repositories directly from the Nectar interface.

- **Automatic Project Association**  
  Each repository is automatically linked to its corresponding LENS Project, ensuring clean alignment between product management and source code.

- **Streamlined Developer Handoff**  
  Once repositories are created and linked, developers can immediately start working without extra configuration.

---

### Benefits

- **Unified Workflow** – No context switching between Nectar and Git providers  
- **Faster Project Setup** – Projects start with a ready-to-use codebase  
- **Traceability** – Every repository is tied to a Nectar project for better tracking  
- **Less Overhead** – Product Owners manage repos directly from Nectar without manual Git setup
