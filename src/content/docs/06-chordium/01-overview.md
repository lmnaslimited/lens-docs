description: All in One Tool for LENS Development Pipeline.

## What is Chordium?

**Chordium** is a unified interface built by the LENS team to keep developers, testers, product owners, and infra teams **on the same page** — without adding yet another tool to the stack.

In modern teams, it's common to juggle multiple systems: project management boards, Git branches, Slack updates, CI pipelines, and more. Chordium simplifies this by **connecting your existing tools** into a single, streamlined interface accessible via the CLI.

## Why Chordium?

Many teams struggle with:

- Missed updates between teams  
- Tool fragmentation (Project Managemet Tool, GitHub, Slack, etc.)  
- Lack of visibility across stories
- Manual sync between tasks and code  

**Chordium solves this by providing:**

- One simple interface for all stakeholders  
- Project management integration that connects issues, branches, and deployments  
- Visibility into who's doing what, and why  
- A CLI-based workflow for developers that doesn't add noise  
- Support for multiple projects and environments
